A personal website made with GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

## Build

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
    * I had trouble installing a compatible Ruby version on Ubuntu 22.04; I used [this article](https://www.mslinn.com/jekyll/6800-jekyll-jammy.html) instead (minus the Docker part)
1. Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies. 
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the local server.
