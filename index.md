Hi there! My name is Pradhapan, but I usually go by **Prad**.

I am a University of Guelph graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Honours Computer Science. During my time there, I
interned at the following companies:

  - [ApplyBoard](https://www.applyboard.com/): *Created a full-stack CSV processing platform*
  - [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/): *Made an open-source GraphQL API building tool*
  - [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/): *Built a JSON diff library for terraform automation*
  - [Wealthsimple](https://wealthsimple.com): *In progress...*

The tasks I work on are typically related to cloud engineering, infrastructure, and distributed systems. However, that doesn't
stop me from jumping into other domains that present interesting challenges. Here's my [resume](/assets/pdf/resume.pdf) with more info.

If you would like to reach out, I can be contacted at [dev@pradr.com](mailto:dev@pradr.com).



<!-- I am a CS + Math undergraduate at the University of Western Ontario.

In the past, I've done research in machine learning and its applications to neuroscience at [The Brain and Mind Institute](https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/): specifically in the topics of approximative inference, hidden Markov models, and unsupervised Bayesian learning.

I've also interned as a software engineer at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) and [Apple](https://www.apple.com).

Currently, I am conducting research under the Department of Mathematics in quantum information theory, and in particular quantum error-correcting codes.

I also occasionally write about interesting topics and problems I've come across. 
Check them out [here](/posts)!

See [/notes](/notes) for my class notes and [/projects](/projects) for projects I've made and worked on! -->
