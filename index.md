Hi there! My name is Pradhapan, but I usually go by **Prad**.

I am a University of Guelph alumnus with a Bachelor's degree in Honours Computer Science. During my time there, I
interned at the following companies:

  - [ApplyBoard](https://www.applyboard.com/): *Recruitment Partner Tooling*
  - [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/): *Serverless Application Experience*
  - [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/): *Cloud Engineering*
  - [Wealthsimple](https://wealthsimple.com): *DIY Core (individual investment platform)*

The problems I work on are typically related to cloud engineering, infrastructure, and distributed systems, but that doesn't
stop me from jumping into other domains that present interesting challenges. Here's my [resume](/assets/pdf/resume.pdf) with more info.

You can also find some of my [projects](/projects) on here, along with [blog posts](/posts) that I write
on things I find cool or helpful.

If you would like to reach out, I can be contacted at [dev@pradr.com](mailto:dev@pradr.com).
