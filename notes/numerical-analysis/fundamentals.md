# Fundamentals

* single precision floating point numbers have 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, 23 mantissa bits
* double precision have 1, 11, 52, respectively
* when truncating floating point numbers, round up if the truncated bit is 1, down otherwise
* relative error is absolute error divided by exact value
